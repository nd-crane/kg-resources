# Knowledge Graph Resources

This repository will serve as a centralized hub where students new to knowledge graphs can access many different resources in order to get up to speed on knowledge graphs. Currently, this repo allows for students to pull in the latest versions of the KGLab tutorials, however, there will be more resources added to this repository in the future. 

## How to pull in the data

After you have cloned the repo into a local environment, run the following command

`dvc pull`

DVC will then pull in the data from the URL's specified in the .dvc files.
